﻿//Yoda is starting his newly created Jedi academy. So, he asked master John to buy the needed equipment.
//The number of items depends on how many students will sign up. The equipment for each Padawan contains:
//•	Lightsaber
//•	Belt
//•	Robe
//You will be given the amount of money John has, the number of students, and the prices of each item.
//Calculate does John has enough money to buy equipment for each Padawan, or how much more money he needs.
//There are some additional requirements: 
//•	Lightsabres sometimes break, so John should buy 10% more (taken from the student's count), rounded up to the next integer
//•	Every sixth belt is free
//Input / Constraints
//The input data should be read from the console. It will consist of exactly 5 lines:
//•	The amount of money John has – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…1,000.00]
//•	The count of students – integer in the range [0…100]
//•	The price of lightsabers for a single saber – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…100.00]
//•	The price of robes for a single robe – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…100.00]
//•	The price of belts for a single belt – the floating-point number in the range [0.00…100.00]
//The input data will always be valid. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output should be printed on the console.
//•	If the calculated price of the equipment is less or equal to the money John has:
//o "The money is enough - it would cost {the cost of the equipment}lv."
//•	If the calculated price of the equipment is more than the money John has:
//o " John will need {neededMoney}lv more."
//•	All prices must be rounded to two digits after the decimal point.
